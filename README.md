We decided to create this browser extension because sometimes when you are watching a baseball game on mlb.tv and you want to see some sort of advanced statistics, or see the current strikezone, but you are not able to without opening a new window or using another device. Our browser extension is designed to allow the user to still watch the current game and be able to see these things at the same time. The extension allows you to see things such as, the current lineup, bench, and bullpen while also being able to click on each of those players names and be able to see advanced statistics about that specific player. Along with that, the extension displays the live strikezone of the current at bat, as well as the current batter and pitcher matchup. Finally, there is a tab that displays the current standings per division.
